# Architecture

The agent is divided into several modules.

| Module     | Job                                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `backends` | all the possible outputs (like stdout, file, databases...)       |
| `config`   | central app configuration                                        |
| `cmd`      | agent entrypoint (it basically manages the run of the agent)     |
| `models`   | definition of the models that represent what could be discovered |
| `modules`  | all the collectors                                               |
| `store`    | internal payload where all the retrieved information are stored  |
| `utils`    | extra helpers                                                    |

The overall architecture is quite classical for plugin-based tools. An orchestrator schedules and runs the available modules and all the collected data can be sent in the backend you want.
