## Run

You guess it. To run the agent, you don't need to provide any extra configuration.

/// tab | Linux

```bash
situation --stdout
```

///

/// tab | Windows

```ps1
situation.exe --stdout
```

///

You will see the json output in the terminal. 



So what you should do next, is to **pipe that json to another tool** (like `jq` see in the [guide](./10_guides/jq-one-liners.md)).

##Â Update

The agent can update itself. It queries Github releases and check if there is a newer version.

/// tab | Linux

```bash
situation update
```

///


/// tab | Windows

```ps1
situation.exe update
```

///

If the new version has breaking changes (when the major version is different) you should pass the `--force` flag to make the update.
