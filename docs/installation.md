## From sources

As the agent makes use of generics, you need to have the [go compiler `>=1.18`](https://go.dev/dl/)

```shell
go install {{ variables.go_module }}
```


!!! warning ""
    [Pre-built binaries](#releases) are compiled with extra flags to reduce the binary size and also set the version inside the binary. See the [Makefile](https://{{ variables.go_module }}/-/blob/main/Makefile) for more details.


!!! warning ""
    The `$GOPATH/bin` folder must be in your PATH to run `situation` directly from the command line
