summary: IT data collection infrastructure
---

Situation is a project that aims to **discover everything** on information systems, on its own.

All IT operations require the knowledge of the underlying infrastructure (network, machines, apps... + all their relations). In practice, **this knowledge is very sparse and unreliable**, aggregated from different source:

- people's knowledge
- outdated diagrams/speadsheets
- home-made scripts or manual debug
- expensive IT tools (or manually-filled CMDB)

Situation provides the core infrastructure to automatically collect and consolidate IT data. Providing then an up-to-date and reliable view of the current state of your infra (or your home LAN).
Now you are ready to build a context-rich IT tool above Situation.
